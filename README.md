# Skip the Queue: An Android App for Ordering from the College Canteen

The Android application was developed to create an easy-to-use and navigate interface, with a user-friendly design. The application was built to allow students and staff of the college to place orders in the canteen without having to stand in long queues. The application made it easier to manage the orders as well.

The objective of the project was achieved by developing a minimalistic application that did not distract Android users from their basic work. The application provided easy access to some of the basic specified applications. A basic user-friendly UI was developed to make the application easy to use.

The project also helped people get information regarding all the camps happening around their locality. Notifications of all the newly added camps were sent to users so that they wouldn't miss any camps. Overall, the project was successful in achieving its objectives and proved to be a useful tool for the students and staff of the college.
